## Weighted Dice

We setup an r object called die that is a vecor of the numbers 1 to 6 using the *:* colon operator and we test some functions on it.

```{r}
die <- 1:6
die

# mean of die
mean(die)

# rounded mean of die
round(mean(die))

# inner and outer matrix multiplication
die %*% die
die %o% die

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
